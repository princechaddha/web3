# web3

Welcome to the 'web3' repo! Here, I'm sharing everything I learn about blockchain technology and web3 security. You’ll find my blog posts, the resources I find helpful, and some of the code I've played around with.

## What’s This Repo All About?

This place is where I jot down my learnings and thoughts as I explore the world of blockchain and web3. It's about learning out loud and helping others along the ride. Here’s what I've covered and what I'm digging into next.
